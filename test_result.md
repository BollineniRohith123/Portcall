# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Create a complete Ultravox AI Voice Agent Implementation for Westports Container Management System with real-time database integration, frontend dashboard, and live demonstration capabilities.

While direct WebSocket testing was not possible in this environment, the API endpoints that trigger WebSocket broadcasts are working correctly."

          comment: "Tested all 5 Ultravox tool endpoints: getContainerStatus, updateContainerStatus, generateEGatepass, checkVesselSchedule, and submitSSR. All endpoints are working correctly with proper validation, error handling, and response formatting. The eGatepass generation correctly validates EDO status and customs clearance. Vessel schedule lookups work by both name and voyage number. SSR submission works for different request types."

          comment: "Dashboard layout and UI components are working correctly. Header with demo badge, connection status, call instructions, stats grid, and container display are all functioning properly. The dashboard displays all sample containers (ABCD1234567, EFGH9876543, MSKU7654321) with correct status badges and details. There is an issue with the WebSocket connection - the UI shows 'Connected' status, but the actual connection fails with error 'WebSocket connection to ws://localhost:443/ws failed'. This appears to be due to incorrect WebSocket URL formation in App.js. Despite this, the dashboard loads initial data correctly and provides a good user experience."

          agent: "testing"
          comment: "The Live Voice Activity section is implemented correctly with proper UI components. The activity feed area is displayed with the correct layout and styling. Activity items show appropriate icons and timestamps. The dashboard is ready to display real-time voice interactions when they occur. However, due to the WebSocket connection issue, real-time updates may not be received. The UI components for displaying activities are working correctly, but the real-time functionality depends on fixing the WebSocket connection."
